			<div class="about_div">
				<p style="width:91%; margin:0 auto">Hello everyone, our website project highlights some of the important features of today's world like Online Gaming, Online Chat and Geolocation. Being a team leader, I assigned task and divided our project work among team members to help each one to work efficiently on their module. We have used technologies such as Node.js, Javascript, Geolocation, Socket.io, PHP, HTML5 and CSS3 in our project. My personal contribution to this project is working on <b style="color:darkkhaki;">PHP</b> technology. PHP is server side scripting language used to display the dynamic content and sometimes for access control. In our project I have used PHP for Login module which checks for correct credentials stored on the server. If the user entered credentials matches with the credentials stored on the server, access is granted to that user. Also, I have used a PHP script in contact section to send an email. Thank you.</p>

			<div class="about_div">
			  <p style="width:91%; margin:0 auto">I am responsible for designing the <b style="color:darkkhaki;">CSS</b> for this website. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS defines how HTML elements are to be displayed. Styles were added to HTML 4.0 to solve a problem. In addition to this it saves a lot of work. External Style Sheets are stored in CSS files. The style definitions are normally saved in external '.css' files. With an external style sheet file, you can change the look of an entire Web site by changing just one file. CSS selectors are used to "find" HTML elements based on their id, class, type, attribute. Here in our project we have used id and class selector. The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. The class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute. Thank you.</p>

			<h3><a href="#">Ruchir Kute</a></h3>
			<div class="about_div">
				<p style="width:91%; margin:0 auto">After the task division by our group leader Vidit, I am responsible for designing the website layout, designing website logo & editing backgrounds using photo shop, placing objects on webpage, working on color scheme of the complete project. Once I finished designing the whole website, we integrated the feature modules on the website which I feel was the difficult part because later I again had to work on the website layout to make it polished and perfect by every means. My personal contribution to this project would be my work on the complete <b style="color:darkkhaki;">HTML5</b> code and applying the CSS. I am glad to study this subject <i>"Web Front-End Programming for Mobile Devices"</i> which therefore helped me to apply my skills in this project. I learnt many things in this semester. All the memories of working together with my teammates will be my great treasury. Thank you!</p>

			<div class="about_div">
				<p style="width:91%; margin:0 auto">The making of project with this team was very influential. The CHAT
interface was my part in this whole project. The chat was created using SOCKET.IO technology. The socket.io is very advanced technology
it has took chatting to very different level. Currently Socket.io is most widely used technology in the app industry to create the chat
apps. I was also responsible for it's UI. It’s very challenging to make chat working this efficiently. Here, we have demonstrated the
future of chat where the user having technical issues will be resolved by the server. The most frequently as well as rarely raised questions
will be present in the server and the response will be available to customer in no time. The project is very influential. I have learned
lot of stuff from this project as well as WEB Front End Technology</p>

			  <p style="width:91%; margin:0 auto">Hello , thank you for visiting our website. I am member of this developer team. As request of team leader(vidit modi) i worked on geolocation. It's pleasure to inform you i really enjoyed it. Now you do not need to enter your address just press key you will get direct address. I have use different kind of language like HTML , php, JavaScript, AJAX in order to make it easy. In this project , you will get your location by longitude and latitude of your location. In this project i have used some methods to get longitude and latitude of location. Here i have used AJAX because when you press button get address you directly get address in box,  do not need to refresh the whole page. Now getting you location is fun now.</p>

			<div class="about_div">
				<p style="width:91%; margin:0 auto">Hi, I am working with Vidit and team on a website project. My contribution to this project is working on the <b style="color:darkkhaki;">JAVASCRIPT</b> in the complete project. Java and JavaScript both are totally different languages. JavaScript is a dynamic programming language. It is most commonly used as a part of web browser, whose implementation allow Client-side script to interact with users. We can change HTML content, attributes, style through JavaScript. We can also validate our data through JavaScript. It is also used in server side network programming with runtime environment such as node.js, game development and creation of desktop and mobile application. Newer and Faster JavaScript Virtual Machines and platforms have also increased the popularity of JavaScript for server-side web application. On the client-side JavaScript has been traditionally implemented as an interpreted language, but more recent browser perform just in time completion. Thank you.</p>
