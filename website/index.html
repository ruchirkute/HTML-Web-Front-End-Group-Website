Online gaming is one of the leading feature in today's world. The expansion of online gaming has reflected the overall expansion of computer networks from small local networks to the internet and the growth of internet access itself. Online games can range from simple text based environments to games incorporating complex graphics and virtual worlds populated by many players simultaneously. On our website we have introduced a small and simple game named "Hit the Dots!". It helps a person to enjoy as well as improve his/her concentration. The advantage of online games is that a great percentage of games donâ€™t require payment. It's free!!</li><br>

Chat messages are generally short in order to enable other participants to respond quickly. Our wensite offers a feature called "Chat Online" to communicate with us if they face any problems on our website. It's a kind of of customer support we provide them for ease of communication.</li><br>
                                            <b><li>Geolocation:</b>&nbsp; Geolocation is the identification of the real-world geographic location of an object, such as a radar source, mobile phone or Internet-connected computer terminal. Geolocation may refer to the practice of assessing the location, or to the actual assessed location. There is no need to type his/her location on our website if a person wish to email us.
